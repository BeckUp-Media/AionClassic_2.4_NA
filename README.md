# AionClassic_2.4

Source code of the Aion Classic server emulator. Version 2.4.<br>

Reworked by <b>BeckUp.Media</b> for correct compile.<br>
And a good structure -.- ... not this weird shit before inside the other Repo. ;)

Original based on Aion-Lightning.

This is an Encom leak, sadness Encom has removed all @author tags. ;(

This repo is only here for save the files and reduce the chance that these files get selled for money.

I did no fork bcs of nothing will happen inside the original src repo. Also here nothing will happen.
I have other stuff todo.

For compile:
- Simply use Ant and batch files, or install intelliJ IDEA, go to settings - plugins.
- Install Ant.
- Go to view, Tool Windows, activate Ant.
- bind in build.xml files from Al-Commons, Al-Login, Al-Game.
- open Ant on right side of IDE, open each Module and hit jar or dist.
